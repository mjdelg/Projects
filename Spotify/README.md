With streaming services being more popular than ever, what makes a song popular is of enormous interest. Using data collected from Spotify API in Kaggle, we investigated the effect of valence, the musical positiveness of songs, on song popularity. We believed that valence would positively contribute to song popularity. We ran multiple regressions by song genre - pop, indie, rap and R&B, electronic, country and folk, rock and metal, classical and instrumental, and international. The other variables besides valence were chosen by variable selection criteria for each genre. After fitting the models, we found that valence was statistically significant for most genres, and a positive change in valence contributed to a negative change in popularity. 

** This project was a team effort. I wrote most of the R code with the excpetion of the model diagnostics graphs.
