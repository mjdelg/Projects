Given the gender bias in the film industry, this project seeks to understand whether passing the Bechdel test relates to the financial resources and financial success of a movie, and if so, to what extent. Using an open source data set compiled by FiveThirtyEight that contains information on 1,794 movies, I performed regression models of Bechdel test outcomes based on different combinations of variables like percent profit, international gross profit, IMDb rating, and the year of the film’s release. I evaluated the models’ performance based on measures of model fit including adjusted R-squared and BIC. The final model suggests that there is a significant negative correlation between a movie’s budget and the number of Bechdel test criteria a film satisfies.
